# The Study
*for Our Networks 2020*

The goal of this creative workshop is to build a literary mesh collectively, exploring the mesh as a kind of narrative structure.

## What we mean by literary mesh

A literary mesh is loosely inspired by the network mesh. As we envision it, a literary mesh means that there is not one way to approach the literary work: we could begin with the end, if there was one. It is a way of playing with the structure holding the written words together, of creating a new scaffold for stories yet to be told.

## Structure of the workshop

In this workshop, we will be using GitHub to collaborate online in the creation of The Study, a not-so-quiet room described below. Please have your GitHub account ready before the beginning of the workshop.

A short introduction to GitHub will be made available shortly, in written form. We will go through it together at the beginning of the workshop.

There will be a presentation on algorithmic literature, e-literature and on recent, networked efforts of collective writings.

Although we expect most people to contribute to the story by writing, we welcome images and code!

# Welcome to The Study

The world we are building is based on the study of some non-descript (for now...!) house.

Meet Clara.

Clara is the main user of this room; she likes to collect a variety of books, along with tiny paintings, elaborate drawings and a diverse range of decorating objects. The study is filled with memories: books from her childhood and books from travels; a few notebooks; notes from classes; family pictures. Clara used to, or maybe still tells you, stories about her life, of which veracity is yet to be established (something you never say a word about). Now, she is letting you in her favorite part of her house; you are becoming friends. 

What will you find on these shelves?

## Looking for an idea ?

Here are some ideas to get you inspired:

* Add a book to the library: maybe the title made you laugh and you decided to read the back cover - what was the book about ? Is it fiction - or is it a manual of electronics ? Did the author signed the book - maybe Clara has met the author and will gladly tell you a story...

* I can tell you one thing: Clara likes to make lists. Books, but also places to visit in her hometown for when new friends are visiting and best songs discovered this month. I would not be surprised to find one where she describes her least favorite flavours of ice cream. Isn't there a small square a paper that looks like one, just here, on the third shelf ?

* As you start to approach an intricate woodbox, Clara offers you tea - this is her collection. Please, let us know everything about the sorts of tea!

* Is Clara a writer ? Or a reader ? Are there any manuscript lying around ? Maybe she does scientific research, or mathematical discoveries... What kind of world is she exploring through this study?

* You could also explore the rest of the house - on invitation only. From the study, we are hearing a documentary being played on the living room television...

* You can also leave the house and explore the hometown. Take an umbrella, is it rainy! Where do we start?
