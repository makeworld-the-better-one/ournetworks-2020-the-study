# About GitHub

GitHub is a platform oriented towards open source projects. It provides version control through [git](https://git-scm.com/), hence the name. 

Here is some information about the platform and about git, and how to use one of them or both for this literary mesh workshop :tada:

## Creating an account

You will need an email address for this. [Click here to access the sign up page](https://github.com/join).

You might want to keep your email from being public: [how to setup GitHub so that your email stays private on the platform](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github).

## What's a repository ?

You can think of a repository as a folder containing a variety of files and subfolders, as well as meta-information about the history of changes to these files and subfolders. Although it is usually a software repository, there can technically have repositories for a diverse range of files.

## How to contribute to a repository

If you are new to the platform, I encourage you to read [this tutorial about GitHub, written by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). We will make good use of the steps 2 (create a branch), 3 (make a commit), and 4 (open a pull request). 

## For this workshop

What I intent is for people to create files, comments, issues and pull requests related to the [ournetworks-2020-the-study](https://github.com/tisserand-workshops/ournetworks-2020-the-study) repository, located on the tisserand-workshops organization account.

**How to contribute to The Study**

I expect participants to the Our Networks 2020 workshop version to follow these steps:

* Set up: fork the repository on your account. You only need to do this once.
* Create a new branch: this is a copy of the main repo that you can modify.
* Add to the branch: you can create new files, upload files to the branch, or push commits from your computer to your GitHub account through the command line.
* Create a pull request: when you make commits to your branch, GitHub will ask you if you want to create a Pull Request. Do this when you are ready to add your changes to the main repository.

You may also contribute to the repository by adding to its meta-information: commenting on others pull requests, reviewing their contribution, and also opening issues. 

**Intent of end result?**

If you are coming from a developer point of view, you might be surprised at the lack of emphasis on having a main branch to which others contribute. This is intentional: I believe that the best *literary* mesh we can make might include having to link between different states in the git history.

## Demo !

Demo time: let's work through some examples together on GitHub.
